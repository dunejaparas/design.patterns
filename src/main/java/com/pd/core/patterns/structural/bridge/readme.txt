When we have interface hierarchies in both interfaces as well as implementations, 
then builder design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client programs. 
Like Adapter pattern, its one of the Structural design pattern.

The implementation of bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer Composition over inheritance. 
Check out Bridge Pattern post for implementation details and sample program.
