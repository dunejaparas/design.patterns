/**
 * The important point to note here is the implementation of dispense method,
 * you will notice that every implementation is trying to process the request
 * and based on the amount, it might process some or full part of it. If itâ€™s
 * not able to process it fully, it sends the request to the next processor in
 * chain to process the remaining request. If the processor is not able to
 * process anything, it just forwards the same request to the next chain.
